                <h3>Hi, I'm JM!</h3>
                <p>
                    I am John Mark Pardo, and I was born in a hospital(IDK where). I am 21 years old, and my birthday is on August 24, 2003. My hobbies include playing computer games, and I love singing even if I'm out of tune. I also enjoy dancing even though I don’t know how. I live in P-2 North Pob., Jose Panganiban, Camarines Norte, together with my family.

                    Most of the time, I spend my life watching TikTok clips, and I also love reading manga and watching anime. My favorite is Hunter x Hunter, and my idol there is Hisoka. As for my professional skills, the only thing I can truly be proud of is that I am good at SQL compared to all the programming languages I know.

                    On the other hand, my weakness would probably be designing. I don’t really have a sense of art, but I can do it if there are proper instructions on how it needs to look.
